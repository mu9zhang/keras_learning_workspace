    "1. The universal way to generate sequence data in deep learning is to train a network (usually an RNN or a convnet) to predict the next\n",
    "   token or next few tokens in a sequence, using the previous tokens as input..As usual when working with text data, tokens are typically\n",
    "   words or characters, and any network that can model the probability of the next token given the previous ones is called a language model.\n",
    "   A language model captures the latent space of language: its statistical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Once you have such a trained language model, you can sample from it (generate new sequences): you feed it an initial string of text\n",
    "    (called conditioning data), ask it to generate the next character or the next word (can even generate several tokens at once), add\n",
    "    the generated output back to the input data, and repeat the process many times. This loop allows you to generate sequences of arbitrary\n",
    "    length that reflect the structure of the data on which the model was trained: sequences that look almost like human-written sentences.\n",

    "Sampling strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When generating text, the way you choose the next character is crucially important. A naive approach is greedy sampling, consisting of\n",
    "   always choosing the most likely next character. But such an approach results in repetitive, predictable strings that don’t look like\n",
    "   coherent language. A more interesting approach makes slightly more surprising choices: it introduces randomness in the sampling process,\n",
    "   by sampling from the probability distribution for the next character. This is called stochastic sampling. In such a setup, if e has\n",
    "   a probability 0.3 of being the next character, according to the model, you’ll choose it 30% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sampling probabilistically from the softmax output of the model is neat: it allows even unlikely characters to be sampled some of\n",
    "   the time, generating more interesting looking sentences and sometimes showing creativity by coming up with new, realistic-sounding\n",
    "   words that didn’t occur in the training data. But there’s one issue with this strategy: it doesn’t offer a way to control\n",
    "   the amount of randomness in the sampling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why would you want more or less randomness? Consider an extreme case: pure random sampling, where you draw the next character from\n",
    "   a uniform probability distribution, and every character is equally likely. This scheme has maximum randomness; in other words, this\n",
    "   probability distribution has maximum entropy. Naturally, it won’t produce anything interesting. At the other extreme, greedy sampling\n",
    "   doesn’t produce anything interesting, either, and has no randomness: the corresponding probability distribution has minimum entropy.\n",
    "   Sampling from the “real” probability distribution — the distribution that is output by the model’s softmax function — constitutes\n",
    "   an intermediate point between these two extremes. But there are many other intermediate points of higher or lower entropy that you may\n",
    "   want to explore. Less entropy will give the generated sequences a more predictable structure (and thus they will potentially be more\n",
    "   realistic looking), whereas more entropy will result in more surprising and creative sequences. When sampling from generative models,\n",
    "   it’s always good to explore different amounts of randomness in the generation process. Because we—humans—are the ultimate judges\n",
    "   of how interesting the generated data is, interestingness is highly subjective, and there’s no telling in advance where the point of\n",
    "   optimal entropy lies.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  In order to control the amount of stochasticity in the sampling process, here introduces a parameter called the softmax temperature\n",
    "    that characterizes the entropy of the probability distribution used for sampling: it characterizes how surprising or predictable\n",
    "    the choice of the next character will be. Given a temperature value, a new probability distribution is computed from the original\n",
    "    one (the softmax output of the model) by reweighting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Higher temperatures result in sampling distributions of higher entropy that will generate more surprising and unstructured generated\n",
